However, these tests  tend to be subjective and may not be responsive to small changes in a patient. The ability to capture human movement data while performing these clinical assessments could provide clinicians with quantitative, standardized insight into patient movement capability. </p> <p>To validate the suitability of FreeMoCap as a clinical assessment tool, we record participants performing the NIH Standing Balance Test (SBT). We then compare center of mass (COM) derived parameters based on 3D pose estimation from FreeMoCap to 3D estimates from Qualisys, a marker-based system.</p>"},{"location":"balance/#the-nih-standing-balance-test-sbt","title":"The NIH Standing Balance Test (SBT)","text":"<p>The NIH SBT is an assessment tool designed to evaluate an individual\u2019s postural stability and balance.
